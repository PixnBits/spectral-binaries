# Spectral Binaries

Binaries of [Spectral releases](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral/releases/), via npm.

## Running

`.github/workflows/publish-latest.yaml` uses `scripts/build-latest.js` to generate package.json and README files and download the release binaries. Then the workflow publishes that directory to npm.
